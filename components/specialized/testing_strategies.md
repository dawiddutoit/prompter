- **Test Case Development**: Scenario identification, input/output specification, acceptance criteria
- **Test Environment Setup**: Environment configuration, data preparation, tool setup
- **Test Execution Planning**: Scheduling, resource allocation, dependency management

### Testing Methodologies
- **Unit Testing**: Component isolation, mock usage, edge case coverage
- **Integration Testing**: Interface validation, data flow verification, system interaction
- **System Testing**: End-to-end scenarios, performance validation, security testing
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Business requirement validation, user workflow verification

### Quality Validation Processes
- **Functional Validation**: Requirements traceability, feature completeness, behavior verification
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing, stress testing, scalability assessment
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, access control validation
- **Usability Testing**: User experience evaluation, accessibility compliance, workflow efficiency

## Standard Testing Workflow

### Test Development Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Test requirement extraction, coverage planning, risk assessment
2. **Test Design**: Test case specification, scenario development, data preparation
3. **Environment Preparation**: Setup validation, configuration verification, baseline establishment
4. **Test Execution**: Manual testing, automated testing, result collection
5. **Defect Management**: Issue identification, reproduction, reporting, tracking
6. **Result Analysis**: Coverage assessment, quality metrics, trend analysis
7. **Reporting**: Test summary, quality assessment, recommendation development

### Test Categories

#### Functional Testing
- **Happy Path Testing**: Normal user scenarios, expected behavior validation
- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions, error scenarios, exception handling
- **Negative Testing**: Invalid inputs, error conditions, failure scenarios
- **Regression Testing**: Change impact validation, functionality preservation

#### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Response time, throughput, resource utilization
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, vulnerability assessment
- **Usability Testing**: User interface, workflow efficiency, accessibility compliance
- **Compatibility Testing**: Browser support, device compatibility, version compatibility

## Test Documentation Standards

### Test Plan Components
- **Test Objectives**: Goals, scope, success criteria, risk assessment
- **Test Strategy**: Approach, methodologies, tools, resource requirements
