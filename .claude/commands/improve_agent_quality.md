## Quality Metrics and Scoring

### Agent Quality Score
Each agent receives a quality score based on:
- **Completeness** (25%): All required components present
- **Consistency** (25%): Parameter and pattern consistency  
- **Validation** (25%): Working validation checkpoints
- **Project Fit** (25%): Relevance to project context

### System Health Score
Overall system health based on:
- **Component Quality**: Individual component scores
- **Integration Quality**: Cross-agent compatibility
- **Documentation Quality**: Completeness and clarity
- **Validation Effectiveness**: Success verification rates

### Quality Reports
