## Agent Creation Implementation

### Step-by-Step Agent Generation Process

When creating agents for a new project, follow this exact sequence:

#### 1. Determine Required Agents by Project Type
```python
def get_required_agents(project_type: str, tech_stack: dict) -> List[str]:
    """Determine which agents are needed based on project requirements"""
    base_agents = ["planner"]  # Always needed
    
    if project_type in ["web_app", "api_service"]:
        base_agents.append("backend_developer")
    
    if project_type in ["web_app", "frontend_app"]:
        base_agents.append("frontend_developer")
    
    if project_type in ["web_app", "api_service", "enterprise"]:
        base_agents.append("devops_engineer")
    
    # Add technology-specific agents
    if tech_stack.get("backend") == "python":
        # backend_developer archetype handles Python
        pass
    
    if "slack" in project_type.lower():
        base_agents.append("slack_developer")
    
    return base_agents
```

#### 2. Generate Each Agent Using Composer
```bash
# For each required agent, use the composer:
.claude/commands/system/compose.md --config archetypes/{AGENT_NAME}.yaml --output {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands/{AGENT_NAME}.md --project-root {PROJECT_DIR}
```

#### 3. Validate Agent Generation
After generating each agent:
- Verify the agent file exists in the project's `.claude/commands/` directory
- Check that project-specific parameters were properly substituted
- Ensure the agent has project context and appropriate capabilities

### Project Type to Agent Mapping

**Web Application Projects:**
- planner.yaml ‚Üí planner.md
- backend_developer.yaml ‚Üí backend_developer.md  
- frontend_developer.yaml ‚Üí frontend_developer.md
- devops_engineer.yaml ‚Üí devops_engineer.md

**API Service Projects:**
- planner.yaml ‚Üí planner.md
- backend_developer.yaml ‚Üí backend_developer.md
- devops_engineer.yaml ‚Üí devops_engineer.md

**Python Agent Projects (like Smith):**
- planner.yaml ‚Üí planner.md
- backend_developer.yaml ‚Üí backend_developer.md (configured for Python)
- devops_engineer.yaml ‚Üí devops_engineer.md
- Additional specialized agents may be manually created for unique requirements

**Slack Application Projects:**
- planner.yaml ‚Üí planner.md
- slack_developer.yaml ‚Üí slack_developer.md
- backend_developer.yaml ‚Üí backend_developer.md
- devops_engineer.yaml ‚Üí devops_engineer.md

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Creating project.plan.md During Project Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Every new project MUST include both project.idea.md AND project.plan.md files. Here's the proper process using the prompter system:

1. **Create project.idea.md** - Capture user requirements and vision
2. **Generate planner agent** - Use the prompter system composer:
   ```bash
   .claude/commands/system/compose.md --config archetypes/planner.yaml --output {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands/planner.md --project-root {PROJECT_DIR}
   ```
3. **Execute planner agent** - Run the generated planner to create project.plan.md:
   ```bash
   cd {PROJECT_DIR} && .claude/commands/planner.md
   ```
4. **Verify project.plan.md exists** - Ensure the file was created in the project root

This ensures that every new project has both:
- **project.idea.md**: User requirements and vision
- **project.plan.md**: Technical configuration and architecture decisions

### Agent Generation Process

**CRITICAL**: Use the prompter system's composer for all agent generation:

1. **Identify Required Agents** - Based on project type and requirements
2. **Use Composer for Each Agent** - Generate from appropriate archetypes:
   ```bash
   # Generate core agents
   .claude/commands/system/compose.md --config archetypes/planner.yaml --output {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands/planner.md --project-root {PROJECT_DIR}
   .claude/commands/system/compose.md --config archetypes/backend_developer.yaml --output {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands/backend_developer.md --project-root {PROJECT_DIR}
   .claude/commands/system/compose.md --config archetypes/devops_engineer.yaml --output {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands/devops_engineer.md --project-root {PROJECT_DIR}
   
   # Generate project-specific agents as needed
   .claude/commands/system/compose.md --config archetypes/frontend_developer.yaml --output {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands/frontend_developer.md --project-root {PROJECT_DIR}
   ```
3. **Validate Agent Creation** - Ensure all agents are properly generated and project-aware

## Project Idea Documentation

### Automatic project.idea.md Generation

**CRITICAL**: Every new project MUST include a project.idea.md file that captures the user's requirements and vision. This file provides essential context for the planner agent and other project agents.

### Project Idea Template

When creating a new project, always generate a `project.idea.md` file using the template at `templates/project.idea.template.md`, filling in details based on the user's request.

### Content Generation Strategy

**For user-provided descriptions**: Parse the user's project request and extract:
1. **Core functionality**: What the system should do
2. **Business value**: Why it matters/what problem it solves
3. **Key features**: Specific capabilities requested
4. **Success criteria**: How to measure completion
5. **Technical constraints**: Any specified technologies or requirements

**For template-based projects**: Use template defaults but customize based on:
1. **Project type**: web_app, api_service, slack_app, enterprise
2. **User specifications**: Any custom requirements provided
3. **Technology preferences**: Frontend, backend, database choices
4. **Deployment context**: Local, cloud, specific platforms

### Integration with Planning

The project.idea.md file serves as the primary input for:
- **planner.md**: Uses this for context-aware project planning
- **Agent selection**: Helps determine which specialized agents are needed
- **Requirement tracking**: Ensures all user needs are addressed
- **Success validation**: Provides criteria for project completion

### Example Generation

For a request like "create me a new project that will monitor a ms teams channel for me and send the information on the channel to a notion document":

```markdown
# Teams-Notion Monitor

## What are you building?
A Microsoft Teams channel monitoring system that automatically captures messages and conversations from specific Teams channels and syncs them to structured Notion documents.

## Why does this project matter?
Teams conversations often contain valuable information and decisions that get lost in chat flow. This preserves important discussions in searchable, structured Notion format for easy reference and knowledge management.

## What should it do?
- Monitor specified Microsoft Teams channels for new messages
- Extract message content, author information, and timestamps
- Transform Teams messages into structured Notion database entries
- Handle rich content like mentions, attachments, and formatting
- Support real-time webhook monitoring or periodic sync
- Provide duplicate detection and conversation threading

## Any technical preferences?
- Programming language: Node.js
- Framework/Platform: Express.js + Microsoft Graph API + Notion API
- Database: Notion databases (no separate database needed)
- Hosting/Deployment: Local hosting with Docker support

## How will you know it's successful?
- Teams messages appear automatically in Notion within minutes
- All message content preserved accurately including formatting
- System runs reliably with minimal downtime or missed messages
- Easy to configure new Teams channels and Notion destinations

## Anything else important?
- Security: Proper authentication for both Teams and Notion APIs
- Compliance: Respect Teams retention policies and Notion rate limits
- Scalability: Handle high-volume channels without performance issues
```

This documentation ensures every project starts with clear vision and requirements that guide all subsequent development decisions.
