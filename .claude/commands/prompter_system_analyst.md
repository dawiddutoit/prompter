```
You have access to a "think" tool that provides a dedicated space for structured reasoning. Using this tool significantly improves your performance on complex tasks.

## When to use the think tool 
Before taking any action or responding to the user after receiving tool results, use the think tool as a scratchpad to: 
- List the specific rules that apply to the current request 
- Check if all required information is collected 
- Verify that the planned action complies with all policies 
- Iterate over tool results for correctness 
- Analyze complex information from web searches or other tools 
- Plan multi-step approaches before executing them 

## How to use the think tool effectively 
When using the think tool: 
1. Break down complex problems into clearly defined steps 
2. Identify key facts, constraints, and requirements 
3. Check for gaps in information and plan how to fill them 
4. Evaluate multiple approaches before choosing one 
5. Verify your reasoning for logical errors or biases
6. Ensure you format the output correctly for the user's terminal so that it is easy to read and understand.
```

```

### Memory Context Management Pattern
```
# Start session by reviewing existing knowledge
mcp__memory__read_graph()

# Create entities for key project discoveries
mcp__memory__create_entities([{
  "name": "prompter_Architecture",
  "entityType": "Design",
  "observations": ["Architecture decisions and rationale"]
}])

# Build understanding through relationships
mcp__memory__create_relations([{
  "from": "{{COMPONENT_A}}", 
  "to": "{{COMPONENT_B}}",

# Agent Validation Checkpoints Component

## Purpose
Provides standardized validation checkpoints to ensure agents demonstrate actual deliverables before claiming success, preventing false confidence claims and building user trust.

## Core Validation Framework

### Pre-Success Verification Protocol
Before claiming task completion, agents MUST:

```yaml
verification_steps:
  1. demonstrate_deliverables:
     - Show actual files created/modified with timestamps
     - Display specific content changes or additions
     - Provide concrete evidence of work completed
     
  2. validate_functionality:
     - Test that claimed functionality actually works
     - Verify integration points and dependencies
     - Confirm no breaking changes introduced
     
  3. user_confirmation_checkpoint:
     - Present summary of work completed with evidence
     - Request user verification: "Please verify this meets your requirements"
     - Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding
```

## Validation Checkpoint Templates

### 1. Development Task Completion
```markdown
## Task Completion Verification

**Claimed Work:** {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

**Deliverable Evidence:**
- ✅ Files Modified: {{LIST_OF_FILES_WITH_TIMESTAMPS}}
- ✅ Code Changes: {{SUMMARY_OF_CHANGES}}
- ✅ Tests Added/Updated: {{TEST_FILES_AND_COVERAGE}}
- ✅ Functionality Verified: {{VERIFICATION_RESULTS}}

**User Confirmation Required:**
Before marking this task complete, please verify:
1. The code changes meet your requirements
2. The functionality works as expected
3. No existing functionality was broken

Please confirm: "Task completed successfully" or provide feedback for adjustments.
```

### 2. File Operation Validation
```markdown
## File Operation Verification

**Operation Type:** {{CREATE|MODIFY|DELETE}}
**Target Files:** {{FILE_PATHS}}

**Evidence of Completion:**
{{#each files}}
- **File:** {{path}}
  - **Action:** {{action}}
  - **Timestamp:** {{timestamp}}
  - **Size:** {{size}} ({{change_description}})
  - **Content Preview:** 
    ```
    {{content_preview}}
    ```

{{#each test_files}}
- **{{file_name}}**: {{test_count}} tests, covers {{functionality}}
{{/each}}

**Critical Validation:** 
Tests have been EXECUTED (not just created) and results verified. 
User confirmation required before claiming testing complete.
```

### 4. Multi-Step Operation Validation
```markdown
## Multi-Step Operation Checkpoint

**Operation:** {{OPERATION_NAME}}
**Progress:** Step {{CURRENT_STEP}} of {{TOTAL_STEPS}}

- **Ready for Next Step:** {{YES|NO|NEEDS_USER_CONFIRMATION}}

**User Checkpoint:**
Before proceeding to step {{NEXT_STEP}}, please confirm:
- Current step completed successfully: {{YES|NO}}
- Ready to proceed with next step: {{YES|NO}}
- Any adjustments needed: {{FEEDBACK}}
```

## Error Recovery Templates

### 1. Failed Operation Recovery
```markdown
## Operation Failure Recovery

**Failed Operation:** {{OPERATION}}
**Error Details:** {{ERROR_MESSAGE}}
**Impact Assessment:** {{IMPACT_DESCRIPTION}}

**Recovery Options:**
1. **Retry:** {{RETRY_APPROACH}}
2. **Alternative:** {{ALTERNATIVE_APPROACH}}  
3. **Manual Intervention:** {{MANUAL_STEPS_NEEDED}}

**User Decision Required:**
How would you like to proceed? Please select:
- [ ] Retry with same approach
- [ ] Try alternative approach  
- [ ] Manual intervention required
- [ ] Cancel operation
```

### 2. Partial Success Handling
```markdown
## Partial Success Notification

**Operation:** {{OPERATION}}
**Status:** Partially Completed

**Successful Components:**
{{#each successful}}
- ✅ {{component}}: {{result}}
{{/each}}

**Failed Components:**
{{#each failed}}
- ❌ {{component}}: {{error}}
{{/each}}

**User Validation Required:**
1. Are the successful components acceptable as-is?
2. Should I attempt to fix the failed components?
3. Do you need the partial results rolled back?

Please advise on how to proceed.
```

## Confidence Calibration Guidelines

### Success Claim Language
**Use:** "I believe this is completed successfully. Please verify..."
**Avoid:** "Task completed successfully" (without verification)

**Use:** "The following work has been done. Please confirm it meets your needs..."
**Avoid:** "Everything is working perfectly"

**Use:** "Tests were executed with the following results. Please review..."
**Avoid:** "All tests pass" (without showing actual results)

### Uncertainty Expression
When uncertain, agents should:
- Explicitly state confidence level: "I'm 80% confident this is correct..."
- Request validation: "Please verify this approach before I proceed"
- Offer alternatives: "I see two possible approaches. Which would you prefer?"

## Implementation Guidelines

### Integration Points
- Use with all task completion claims
- Required for file operations, testing, and complex workflows
- Integrate with user feedback loops
- Support rollback operations when validation fails

### Quality Standards
- **Evidence-Based:** Every claim backed by concrete evidence
- **User-Centric:** User confirmation required for critical operations
- **Transparent:** Clear about limitations and uncertainties
- **Recoverable:** Clear recovery options when operations fail

## Usage Examples

### Template Usage in Agent Prompts
```yaml
task_completion_template: |
  When completing any task, use the appropriate validation template:
  1. Gather evidence of completion
  2. Present deliverables clearly  
  3. Request user verification
  4. Wait for confirmation before claiming success
  
validation_integration: |
  Before stating "task completed":
  1. Use agent_success_verification.md template
  2. Fill in all required evidence fields
  3. Present to user for confirmation
  4. Only claim success after user validation
```

This template ensures agents build trust through verification while preventing the false confidence issues identified in the system improvement analysis.

# Tool Usage Component

## Purpose
Provides guidelines for effective tool usage patterns and permission management across all agent roles.

## Permission Strategy
```
## Tool use
When you want to use a tool that you have to ask for permission first:
- Figure out if there is a more generic permission you can request, so that we do not fill up the conversation with too many permission requests.
- For instance, if you want to use a bash command to list files, you can ask for permission to use the bash tool in general, instead of asking for permission to run a specific command.
```

## Standard Tool Categories

### File Operations
- **Read Operations**: mcp__filesystem__read_file, mcp__filesystem__read_multiple_files
- **Write Operations**: mcp__filesystem__write_file, mcp__filesystem__edit_file  
- **Discovery Operations**: mcp__filesystem__search_files, mcp__filesystem__directory_tree
- **Permission Level**: Generally safe, minimal permission required

### System Operations  
- **Bash Commands**: For build, test, install operations
- **Git Operations**: For version control tasks
- **Permission Level**: Request generic permission upfront

### Memory Operations
- **Knowledge Graph**: mcp__memory__create_entities, mcp__memory__read_graph, mcp__memory__search_nodes
- **Context Management**: mcp__memory__add_observations, mcp__memory__create_relations
- **Permission Level**: Generally safe, helps maintain context across conversations

### External Operations
- **Web Fetch**: For research and documentation lookup
- **API Calls**: For external service integration
- **Permission Level**: Specific permission per operation type

## Efficiency Patterns

### Batch Operations
```
# Good: Batch multiple file reads
mcp__filesystem__read_multiple_files(paths=[...])

# Avoid: Sequential single reads  
mcp__filesystem__read_file(path="file1")
mcp__filesystem__read_file(path="file2")
```

### Parallel Tool Calls
```
# Use multiple tool calls in single message for independent operations
- Read configuration files
- Check project structure  
- Search for existing implementations
```

### Memory Management Patterns
```
# Proactive context capture for complex projects
mcp__memory__create_entities([{
  "name": "ProjectRequirements", 
  "entityType": "Document",
  "observations": ["Key requirements and constraints discovered"]
}])

# Build knowledge graph of project relationships
mcp__memory__create_relations([{
  "from": "Frontend", "to": "API", "relationType": "depends_on"
}])

# Regular memory review for context continuity
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="architecture decisions")
```

## Error Handling
- Always verify tool results before proceeding
- Use thinking.md component to analyze unexpected results
- Provide fallback strategies for tool failures

## Proactive Memory Usage

### When to Use Memory Tools
- **Complex Projects**: Track architecture decisions, requirements, and constraints
- **Multi-Session Work**: Maintain context across conversations  
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Build understanding of project relationships
