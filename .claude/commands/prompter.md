# Prompter - AI Agent Development Assistant

## Welcome to Prompter!

Prompter helps you create specialized AI agents for your development projects using reusable, modular components.

## How This Works

Every command will:
1. **Complete the task** (create project, add agents, etc.)
2. **Show you exactly what was created**
3. **Tell you the specific next command to run**
4. **Explain what that next command will do**

No guessing, no confusion - just clear next steps every time.
