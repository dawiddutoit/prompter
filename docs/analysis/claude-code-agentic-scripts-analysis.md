- **Configuration-Driven**: Centralized config with environment adaptation

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Telemetry-Driven Architecture

**Pattern Description:** Every script is automatically wrapped with comprehensive telemetry collection that enables collective
learning and continuous improvement.

**Key Components:**
- `enhanced-telemetry-collector.sh`: 500+ lines of sophisticated data collection
- Real-time metrics: tokens, API calls, memory, CPU, network usage
- Pattern detection and collaborative learning between repositories
- Health scoring with auto-remediation capabilities

**Integration Value for Prompter:**
- **Speed**: Real-time bottleneck identification and optimization opportunities
- **Robustness**: Proactive issue detection and auto-remediation capabilities
- **Learning**: Continuous improvement through pattern recognition and collective intelligence

**Implementation Pattern:**
```bash
# Auto-initialization at script start
source enhanced-telemetry-collector.sh
export COLLECTIVE_SCRIPT_NAME="script-name"

# During execution
record_api_call 150 "claude" 0.9 250  # tokens, type, quality, latency
record_pattern "optimization_found" '{"improvement": "25% faster"}' 0.8 0.7
record_discovery "new_capability" '{"type": "prompt_optimization"}' 0.9 0.8

# Automatic cleanup and reporting at exit
```

### 2. Advanced Claude SDK Integration

**Pattern Description:** Sophisticated Claude SDK usage patterns that maximize performance and reliability through session management, 
streaming, and structured outputs.

**Key Patterns:**
- **Session-Based Interactions**: Persistent context across operations
- **Streaming Operations**: Real-time processing for large-scale operations  
- **Structured JSON Outputs**: Reliable programmatic parsing
- **Advanced Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation and retry mechanisms

**Examples from Repository:**
```bash
# Session initialization with context preservation
SESSION_ID=$(claude -p "Initialize debugging session" \
    --output-format json \
    --system-prompt "Expert debugging assistant" \
    2>/dev/null | jq -r '.session_id')

# Streaming for large operations
(while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo '{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"'$(echo "$line" | sed 's/"/\\"/g')'"}]}}'
done < "$PIPE") | claude -p \
    --input-format stream-json \
    --output-format stream-json \
    --resume "$SESSION_ID" \
    --max-turns 100

analyze_evolution_effectiveness() {
    # Gather performance metrics
    # Identify bottlenecks and opportunities
    # Generate improvement strategies
    # Test and validate improvements
    # Apply successful modifications
}

# Evolve the evolution process itself

    local error_type="${2:-generic}"
    local severity="${3:-medium}"
    local context="${4:-{}}"
    
    ((ERROR_COUNT++))
    
    local error_record=$(cat <<EOF
{
    "error_message": $(echo "$error_msg" | jq -R .),
    "error_type": "$error_type", 
    "severity": "$severity",
    "context": $context,
    "timestamp": "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%3NZ")",
